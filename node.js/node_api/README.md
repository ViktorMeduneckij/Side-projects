## Node API
A small project with a goal to implement a simple API. Main intention is to get to know `node.js` and learn how to provide myself an API for future projects.
Functionality includes an ability to create events with some predefined schema (using `Mongoose`) and store it in `MongoDB`, as well as
retreiving data in `JSON` format.
The application uses `Express` web application framework.
